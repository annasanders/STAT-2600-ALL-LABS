# Suicide Prevention
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016

Mental health is becoming more and more important in relation to overall health and wellbeing. In the instance where mental health is not being taken care of, people can turn to addictive substances, preversive behavior, or even death.

For this lab, our domain expert is The World Health Organization (WHO https://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/en/). We believe this data set, which has data from multiple different countries and years, would best help answer the question: Who is most at risk to commit suicide? Answering this question can help governments and other global health organizations better identify and assist those contemplating suicide.

### Chris (GDP, #)

### Amanda (Gender, #)
I want to kow about stuff
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#View(suicides)
suicides <- read.table(file= "master.xls", sep= "\t", header= TRUE, na.strings=c("NA", "", "?", 0))
suicideByGender <- select(suicides, sex, suicides_no, country) %>% drop_na()
#View(suicideByGender)
ggplot(data=suicideByGender, aes(x=country, y=suicides_no, fill=sex)) + geom_col() + labs(x="Gender", y="Number Of Suicides", title = "Number of Suicides by Country and Gender", legend = "Gender") + coord_flip()


```


### James (Who knows)

### Anna (Generation/Age, #)
My variables looked at the difference in age and generation with total numbers of suicides. Knowing this information would greatly help medical professionals focus in on certain ages or generations to further prevent suicides.

__Generation Breakdown (approximate)__
Generation Name      | Age Breakdown (Years)
-------------------- | ------------- 
Generation Z         | 7-24        
Millennials          | 25-39   
Generation X         | 40-54  
Baby Boomer          | 55-73  
Silent Generation    | 74-94  
G.I. Generation      | 95-109  

To answer this question, I first sorted out the varibles I wanted (age, generation, and suicides_no) and then sumed the suicides_no associated with each generation/age. I then created a ggplot bar graph to show the difference between each variable (age/generation).  

```{r, echo= FALSE}
# Primary Sorting
agecount <- suicides %>%
  select("age", "suicides_no", "generation")

# Breakdown of Variables
generationtotal <- agecount %>%
  group_by(generation) %>%
  summarise(total= sum(suicides_no))

agetotal <- agecount %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(suicides_no))

# ggplot Code
ggplot(data= generationtotal)+
  geom_bar(mapping= aes(x=generation, y=total, fill=generation), stat= "identity")+
  labs(title= "Total Suicides for Different Generations")+
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Total Suicides (Millions)",
                     breaks= c(0, 500000, 1000000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000), 
                     labels= c("0", "0.5", "1", "1.5", "2", "2.5"),
                     limits= c(0,2500000))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits= c("Generation Z", "Millenials", "Generation X", "Boomers", "Silent", "G.I. Generation"))+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x= element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+
  scale_fill_discrete(name= "Generation",
                      breaks= c("Generation Z", "Millenials", "Generation X", "Boomers", "Silent", "G.I. Generation"))
                      
ggplot(data= agetotal)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=age, y=total, fill=age), stat= "identity")+
  labs(y="Total Suicides", title= "Total Suicides for Different Age Groups")+
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Total Suicides (Millions)",
                     breaks= c(0, 500000, 1000000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000), 
                     labels= c("0", "0.5", "1", "1.5", "2", "2.5"),
                     limits= c(0,2500000))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits= c("5-14 years","15-24 years", "25-34 years", "35-54 years", "55-74 years", "75+ years"))+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x= element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+
  scale_fill_discrete(name= "Age Group",
                      breaks= c("5-14 years","15-24 years", "25-34 years", "35-54 years", "55-74 years", "75+ years"),
                      labels=c("5-14 Years","15-24 Years", "25-34 Years", "35-54 Years", "55-74 Years", "75+ Years"))
```

From these two graphs, one can clearly see that the largest age group and generation is those 35-54 years old and the Baby Boomer generation. This information can help health professionals better information on which individuals are more likely to commit suicide.
