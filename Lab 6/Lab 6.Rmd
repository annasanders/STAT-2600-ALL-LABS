### Why it is imporant (Anna)
As a member of the Illumanati and an Acolyte of Blucifer, the operations of the Denver International Airport (which shortens to DIA, but has DEN as its airport code) are of great imporantce (https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/denver-airport-conspiracy-theories). As DIA goes though a series of construction projects, it is even more important that the ariport runs as normally as possible to make sure excess suspicion is aroused. In order to remain a 'normal airport' the pubic's eye, DIA must continue to deliver its patrons (both human and lizard) to their destinations with little delays (http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/03/17/the_blue_mustang_is_part_of_several_conspiracy_theories_centered_on_denver.html). To help recomend solutions, our team has come up with multiple plots and recomendations to help keep DIA running smoothly.
