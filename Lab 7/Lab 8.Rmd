How does average global active power change every month throughout the four years? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
householdpwr<-housepwr %>% 
  separate(Date, into = c("Day","Month","Year"), sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>%
  select(Day,Month,Year,Global_active_power)

householdpwr2 <- householdpwr %>%
  group_by(Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(mean_pwr = mean(Global_active_power, na.rm = TRUE) , count = n())

```

The question that I am attempting to solve is: Is there a difference in energy usage for heating and cooling per over the years?

To solve this question, I picked two months (June and December) where I though the difference between energy usage would be high (as many people use heating/cooling this month). I created many tibbles that isolated the time (in minutes) and Sub_metering_3 (which measured energy usage of heating and cooling). I choose one day out of each month and year combination (all around the same date) and made sure it had 1440 data points. I then put the data into a ggplot. I chose to use geom_step as the data was not a completly continuous series, but functioned close enough to one.

                       stringsAsFactors= FALSE)

As you can see from the graphs above, later years in both the months of June and December used more power overall.
