__Overall Question__: What are the differences between different ages and genders in the amount of exercise per month?


__Why it is important__: There are many generational differences between people. Even now we see younger generations smoking less than the older ones (see Chris's graph). In order to better prepare all generations for a healthier life, we first need to see the differences between different ages' exercise habits. This will help us make recommendations to both parents of children and health care providers to help increase the overall health of all people. We also want to see the differences between genders in terms of exercise habits and health, as different genders have different body types and therefore do not benefit from the same kinds of exercise in the same way.

ggplot(data=cdc,aes(x=age,color=gender))+geom_area(stat="bin")+facet_wrap(~exerany)+
labs(x='Age',y='Count of People',title='Exercise and Age (0 = No exercise, 1 = Exercise)')


__Findings__: In this plot, we can see that more people around the age range of 25-50 exercise than not. 
We can also see that over the age of 35-40, the number of people who both do and do not exercise decreases. 
In addition, we have color coded by gender to see how exercise patterns may differ between males and females, and both groups ended up
following similar patterns to how their exercise happens change by age. 

In this plot, we can see that more people around the age range of 25-50 exercise than not. We can also see that over the age of 35-40, the number of people who both do and do not exercise decreases.  

__Conclusion__: From this plot, we can conclude that while most people do exercise, the largest group of people who do not exercise is between ages 35-40. Furthermore, gender does not largely affect exercise habits as people age.

__Recommendations__: From this graph, we can see, on average, people of all ages exercice more than they do not. However, there are still a large number of people, particularly around the ages of 30-45, who do not exercise. From this finding, we recommend for doctors and general practitioners to focus on individuals within that age range in order to increase the number of people who exercise. 

## Height, Weight, and Gender(James)
![James' Plot](Plot/height_vs_weight.png)

Because height and weight are both continuous variables, I used the smooth geom. 
This allowed me to see the clear relationship between height and weight, and how the slope varies as a function of weight.

Some noticeable features are that the height for both men and women tend to approach an asymptote.

I believe that this is best explained by the fact that humans reach a peak in their height, but can continue to put on weight. 

One other interesting aspect is how the slope varies. Initially, for both men and women, the slope is steep, but as weight increases, the slope decreases some.  

## Weight,  Weight Desire, and Gender(Amanda)
![Amanda's Plot](/Users/amandaliddle4/Desktop/amandaplot.png) 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc, mapping = aes(x=gender, y=weight-wtdesire, color = gender)) + geom_boxplot() +
 labs(x='Gender', y= 'Pounds Above Desired Weight', title = 'Distance to Desired Weight Based on Gender') + 
 coord_flip()
```

I used the boxplot geom to create two separate boxplots--one for each gender, and I looked at how far people tend to be from their desired weight. The x-axis is represented by weight minus desired weight, so positive numbers indicate that a person is above their desired weight. I also switched the coordinates of the boxplot so it would be easier to read, in addition to the label function in order to give the graph a title and labels on both axes. The information on the graph suggests that 75% of both males and females from the study seem to be above their desired weight.ore females tended to be farther away from their desired weight than males.

This graph helps support our overarching question because it points out how far each gender tends to be from their health goals regarding their weight. It illustrates that most people from both genders weigh more than they would desire, which could play a part in how their exercise patterns work.

## Weight and Age (Chris)
Question: HOw do mean weights vary over age groups? Can we model this with an equation? 


```{r, eval= FALSE}
 ggplot(data = cdc, aes(x = smoke100, y = age , color = gender))+ geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y" , stackdir = "center", binwidth = 1/20) + labs(x ='Do they smoke?', y = 'age', title = 'Age correlation to smoking')


mean_weight <- cdc %>%
  select(age,weight) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(mean_wght = mean(weight))

summary(mean_weight)

mean_weight %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, mean_wght)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Full data = ")


age_mod1 <- lm(mean_wght ~ age, data = mean_weight)
age_mod2 <- lm(mean_wght ~ ns(age,2) , data = mean_weight)
age_mod3 <- lm(mean_wght ~ns(age,3), data = mean_weight)

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Linear trend + ")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Quadratic trend + ")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Cubic trend + ")


mean_weight %>% 
  add_residuals(age_mod1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "white", size = 10) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Remaining pattern of linear model")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_residuals(age_mod2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "white", size = 10) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Remaining pattern of quadratic model")




```

In this analysis, I used the data to try and figure out the general trends between age and weight. These statistics can be used to determine genreal health relationships among age groups: for instance, obesity is a major contributing factor towards heart disease, and being underweight can cause osteoperosis or anemia. If we can show a relationship between ages and weight, we can better target certain groups to make sure they maintain a healthy level of weight. I tidied the data to only reflect the age and weight of people in the data set. Then, I grouped by age to find the mean weight of each age group from 18-99. After that, I made two functionss: one that finds a linear model of the tidy data, and one that finds a quadrartic model to fit the data by using predictions from the data. After this, I found the residuals of the respective models. I then plotted both the model and their residuals to determine which was better, as well as the full data without a model. This analysis revealed that the Quadratic model was much more accurate as seen on the residual plot. The residual plot of the linear model shows a clear concave-down quadric function that was still present in the data. The residual from the quadratic model showed no clear trend, apart from an increasing periodic trend that is more prominent in older ages. We can hypothesize that this is reflective of noise in the data and in lack of as many data points for older people(50-99) than in younger age groups(18-50). From this, we can see that people in the age group of 40-60 are , on average, the heaviest group, so they should be monitered more closely for diseases that stem from being overweight. We can also see that the 65+ age group loses weight rapidly, so they should be monitored for too quick of weight loss as well and should focus on retaining weight to remain healthy. We can use this to warn groups approaching these age categories to be cognizant of their weight and to try and prevent any drastic changes to preserve their health.

## General Health and Health Plan (Anna)
![Anna's Plot](Plot/Anna's Plot.png) 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc,aes(x=hlthplan,y=genhlth))+
      geom_count(aes(color=..n..))+
      labs(x='Health Plan', y='General Helth', title= 'Health Plan and General Health',color='People')+
      scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,1),labels=c('No','Yes'))
```

I used the geom_count() function to plot the genhlth and hlthplan variables. I chose to use this plot because the data only contained 10 unique options (hlthplan, although represented numerically, only had two responses). By grouping the same points together, one can better see the relationship between an assessment of general health and whether or not an individual has a health plan or not. 

To better represent this data, I found a way to both aesthetically mark the amount of individuals represented in a data point by color and size. I also renamed the legend to better label the data. 

The overall finding I was able to see from this graph is that on average, there are more people who have a health plan than who do not and those people have an overall better general than those who do not.

## Team Contributions

We all spent time working with the graphing capabilities of R and each created our own plot that supports the overarching question of the lab. 

We all posted our parts to the shared document and wrote summaries/descriptions to go with our data. Anna, Chris, and James worked through plotting the team graph, and Amanda and Anna wrote in an analysis, conclusion, and recommendations for the findings. Amanda then edited thefinal document and did the finishing touches to turning it in.
