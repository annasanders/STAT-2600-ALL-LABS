__Overall Question__: What are the differences between different ages and genders in the amount of exercise per month?


__Why it is important__: There are many generational differences between people. Even now we see younger generations smoking less than the older ones (see Chris's graph). In order to better prepare all generations for a healthier life, we first need to see the differences between different ages' exercise habits. This will help us make recommendations to both parents of children and health care providers to help increase the overall health of all people. We also want to see the differences between genders in terms of exercise habits and health, as different genders have different body types and therefore do not benefit from the same kinds of exercise in the same way.

![Our Group Plot](Plot/age_vs_exercise.png)


```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc,aes(x=age,color=gender))+geom_area(stat="bin")+facet_wrap(~exerany)+
labs(x='Age',y='Count of People',title='Exercise and Age (0 = No exercise, 1 = Exercise)')
```


__Findings__: In this plot, we can see that more people around the age range of 25-50 exercise than not. 
We can also see that over the age of 35-40, the number of people who both do and do not exercise decreases. 
In addition, we have color coded by gender to see how exercise patterns may differ between males and females, and both groups ended up
following similar patterns to how their exercise happens change by age. 

In this plot, we can see that more people around the age range of 25-50 exercise than not. We can also see that over the age of 35-40, the number of people who both do and do not exercise decreases.  

__Conclusion__: From this plot, we can conclude that while most people do exercise, the largest group of people who do not exercise is between ages 35-40. Furthermore, gender does not largely affect exercise habits as people age.

__Recommendations__: From this graph, we can see, on average, people of all ages exercice more than they do not. However, there are still a large number of people, particularly around the ages of 30-45, who do not exercise. From this finding, we recommend for doctors and general practitioners to focus on individuals within that age range in order to increase the number of people who exercise.

We also looked at the percentage of people that wanted to lose weight and exercised versus people that wanted to lose weight and not exercise. These proportions are visualized in the plot below.
![](Plots/tplot1.png)
Some interesting probabilities that are associated with this plot are the conditional probabilities of someone going to the gym given that they want to lose weight. For females, this probability is 74%, and for males it is 77%. We also wanted to calculate the percentage of males and females that try to lose weight by going to the gym. For males, this was 42%, and for females it was 52%. To determine if this difference in percentages was statistically significant, we performed a permutation test. 
![](Plots/tplot2.png)
This plot contains our approximate distribution of our permutation test and our observed difference. Clearly, this difference is significant.

## Height, Weight, and Gender(James)
![James' Plot](Plot/height_vs_weight.png)

Because height and weight are both continuous variables, I used the smooth geom. 
This allowed me to see the clear relationship between height and weight, and how the slope varies as a function of weight.

Some noticeable features are that the height for both men and women tend to approach an asymptote.

I believe that this is best explained by the fact that humans reach a peak in their height, but can continue to put on weight. 

One other interesting aspect is how the slope varies. Initially, for both men and women, the slope is steep, but as weight increases, the slope decreases some.  

## Weight,  Weight Desire, and Gender(Amanda)
![Amanda's Plot](/Users/amandaliddle4/Desktop/amandaplot.png) 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc, mapping = aes(x=gender, y=weight-wtdesire, color = gender)) + geom_boxplot() +
 labs(x='Gender', y= 'Pounds Above Desired Weight', title = 'Distance to Desired Weight Based on Gender') + 
 coord_flip()
```

I used the boxplot geom to create two separate boxplots--one for each gender, and I looked at how far people tend to be from their desired weight. The x-axis is represented by weight minus desired weight, so positive numbers indicate that a person is above their desired weight. I also switched the coordinates of the boxplot so it would be easier to read, in addition to the label function in order to give the graph a title and labels on both axes. The information on the graph suggests that 75% of both males and females from the study seem to be above their desired weight.ore females tended to be farther away from their desired weight than males.

This graph helps support our overarching question because it points out how far each gender tends to be from their health goals regarding their weight. It illustrates that most people from both genders weigh more than they would desire, which could play a part in how their exercise patterns work.

## Smoke and Age (Chris)

![Chris' Plot](Plot/Chris' Plot.png)

```{r, eval= FALSE}
 ggplot(data = cdc, aes(x = smoke100, y = age , color = gender))+ geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y" , stackdir = "center", binwidth = 1/20) + labs(x ='Do they smoke?', y = 'age', title = 'Age correlation to smoking')
```

I created a plot showing how age and smoking are related and how this is segmented by gender. 
The data showed a few things: first that there were a lot more females than males in the sampled population and 
second that there were larger groups of people who smoked in the age range of about 35-50. 
It also showed that a much larger proportion of the age group of 60-75 were smokers. 
Finally, it showed that those over the age of 80 were primarily non-smokers. 

I used the geom_dotplot function and adjusted the color of the points to reflect the gender of the person behind 
the point in question. In addition, I adjusted the size of the points in the dotplot to be significantly smaller to handle the bulk of data; the default size was much too large. I also changed the default labels to make the plot easier to read.

## General Health and Health Plan (Anna)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Renaming the genhlth column
cdc2 <- cdc%>%
  mutate(genhlth= as.character(cdc$genhlth))

cdc3<- cdc2%>%
  mutate(hlthnum= as.numeric(str_replace_all(genhlth, c("poor"= "1", "fair"= "2", "^good"= "3", "very good"= "4", "excellent"= "5"))))

cdc4<- cdc3%>%
  mutate(genhlthf=as.factor(cdc$genhlth))

cdc4$genhlthf%>%
  fct_relevel("poor", "fair", "good", "very good")%>%
  levels()

# Statistics
## Overall
mean(cdc3$hlthnum)
sd(cdc3$hlthnum)
## Yes Health Plan
cdcno <- cdc3%>%
  filter(hlthplan== "0")
mean(cdcno$hlthnum)
sd(cdcno$hlthnum)

## No Health Plan
cdcyes <- cdc3%>%
  filter(hlthplan== "1")
mean(cdcyes$hlthnum)
sd(cdcyes$hlthnum)

# New Plots
ggplot(data=cdc3, aes(x=as.factor(hlthplan), y=hlthnum))+
  geom_violin()+
  labs(x="Health Plan", y="General Health", title="Health Plan and General Helath")

ggplot(data=cdc4)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=genhlthf, fill=as.factor(hlthplan)))+
  labs(x="General Health", y="Count", title="General Health and Health Plan")+
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Health Plan", breaks=c("1", "0"), labels=c("Yes", "No"))+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("poor","fair","good","very good","excellent"), 
                   labels=c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"))

__Statistics of General Heatlh__

Health Plan|Mean   |SD
-----------|-------|-------
Overall    |3.64565|1.04859
Yes        |3.67813|1.041252
No         |3.42076|1.071586

I updated the graphs to better represent the data. I also calculated the means and standard deviations for each health plan as well as the overall mean and standard deviation. From these results, I conluded that while having a health plan increased your overall health, it was not by much (0.2 difference in means). Similarly, looking at the first graph, most people have a health plan than do not, so the relation between general health and data could be further explored with more data from individuals who do not have a helath plan. 

I used the recently learned skill of string detection and factors in order to change the genhelth column to numbers in order to calculate mean and standard deviation. 

## Team Contributions

We all spent time working with the graphing capabilities of R and each created our own plot that supports the overarching question of the lab. 

We all posted our parts to the shared document and wrote summaries/descriptions to go with our data. Anna, Chris, and James worked through plotting the team graph, and Amanda and Anna wrote in an analysis, conclusion, and recommendations for the findings. Amanda then edited thefinal document and did the finishing touches to turning it in.
