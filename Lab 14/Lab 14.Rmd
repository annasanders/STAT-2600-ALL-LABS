__Overall Question__: What are the differences between different ages and genders in the amount of exercise per month? 

__Why it is important__: There are many generational differences between people. Even now we see younger generations smoking less than the older ones (see Chris's graph). In order to better prepare all generations for a healthier life, we first need to see the differences between different ages' exercise habits. This will help us make recommendations to both parents of children and health care providers to help increase the overall health of all people. We also want to see the differences between genders in terms of exercise habits and health, as different genders have different body types and therefore do not benefit from the same kinds of exercise in the same way.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc,aes(x=age, fill=as.factor(exerany)))+
  geom_area(stat="bin")+
  facet_wrap(~gender)+
  scale_fill_discrete(name= "Exercise", breaks=c("0", "1"), labels=c("No","Yes"))+
  labs(x="Age",y="Count of People",title="Exercise and Age)")
```

In this plot, we can see that for both Males and Females, at around the ages of 25-50 and 60-75, there are large amounts of people who do not exercise at all. This is problematic expecially in older ages as exercise become more important in order to be healthier when older.

We also looked at the percentage of people that wanted to lose weight and exercised versus people that wanted to lose weight and not exercise. These proportions are visualized in the plot below.

![](Plots/tplot1.png)

Some interesting probabilities that are associated with this plot are the conditional probabilities of someone going to the gym given that they want to lose weight. For females, this probability is 74%, and for males it is 77%.

We also wanted to calculate the percentage of males and females that try to lose weight by going to the gym. For males, this was 42%, and for females it was 52%. To determine if this difference in percentages was statistically significant, we performed a permutation test.

![](Plots/tplot2.png)

This plot contains our approximate distribution of our permutation test and our observed difference. Clearly, this difference is significant.

We overall recommend that doctors and providers put emphasis on those between the ages of 25 and 75 in order to increase the amount of people who exercise. We also recommend to emphasize excersising as a means to lose weight as there are still a small portiion of people who want to lose weight and do not exercise for whatever reason.

## Height, Weight, and Gender(James)
![James' Plot](Plot/height_vs_weight.png)

Because height and weight are both continuous variables, I used the smooth geom. 
This allowed me to see the clear relationship between height and weight, and how the slope varies as a function of weight.

Some noticeable features are that the height for both men and women tend to approach an asymptote.

I believe that this is best explained by the fact that humans reach a peak in their height, but can continue to put on weight. 

One other interesting aspect is how the slope varies. Initially, for both men and women, the slope is steep, but as weight increases, the slope decreases some.  

## Weight,  Weight Desire, and Gender(Amanda)
![Amanda's Plot](/Users/amandaliddle4/Desktop/amandaplot.png) 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=cdc, mapping = aes(x=gender, y=weight-wtdesire, color = gender)) + geom_boxplot() +
 labs(x='Gender', y= 'Pounds Above Desired Weight', title = 'Distance to Desired Weight Based on Gender') + 
 coord_flip()
```

I used the boxplot geom to create two separate boxplots--one for each gender, and I looked at how far people tend to be from their desired weight. The x-axis is represented by weight minus desired weight, so positive numbers indicate that a person is above their desired weight. I also switched the coordinates of the boxplot so it would be easier to read, in addition to the label function in order to give the graph a title and labels on both axes. The information on the graph suggests that 75% of both males and females from the study seem to be above their desired weight.ore females tended to be farther away from their desired weight than males.

This graph helps support our overarching question because it points out how far each gender tends to be from their health goals regarding their weight. It illustrates that most people from both genders weigh more than they would desire, which could play a part in how their exercise patterns work.

## Weight and Age (Chris)
Question: How do mean weights vary over age groups? Can we model this with an equation? 


```{r, eval= FALSE}
 ggplot(data = cdc, aes(x = smoke100, y = age , color = gender))+ geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y" , stackdir = "center", binwidth = 1/20) + labs(x ='Do they smoke?', y = 'age', title = 'Age correlation to smoking')


mean_weight <- cdc %>%
  select(age,weight) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(mean_wght = mean(weight))

summary(mean_weight)

mean_weight %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, mean_wght)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Full data = ")


age_mod1 <- lm(mean_wght ~ age, data = mean_weight)
age_mod2 <- lm(mean_wght ~ ns(age,2) , data = mean_weight)
age_mod3 <- lm(mean_wght ~ns(age,3), data = mean_weight)

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Linear trend + ")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Quadratic trend + ")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_predictions(age_mod3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, pred)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Cubic trend + ")


mean_weight %>% 
  add_residuals(age_mod1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "white", size = 10) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Remaining pattern of linear model")

mean_weight %>% 
  add_residuals(age_mod2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, resid)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "white", size = 10) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Remaining pattern of quadratic model")

```

In this analysis, I used the data to try and figure out the general trends between age and weight. These statistics can be used to determine genreal health relationships among age groups: for instance, obesity is a major contributing factor towards heart disease, and being underweight can cause osteoperosis or anemia. If we can show a relationship between ages and weight, we can better target certain groups to make sure they maintain a healthy level of weight. 

I tidied the data to only reflect the age and weight of people in the data set. Then, I grouped by age to find the mean weight of each age group from 18-99. After that, I made two functionss: one that finds a linear model of the tidy data, and one that finds a quadrartic model to fit the data by using predictions from the data. After this, I found the residuals of the respective models. I then plotted both the model and their residuals to determine which was better, as well as the full data without a model. This analysis revealed that the Quadratic model was much more accurate as seen on the residual plot. 

The residual plot of the linear model shows a clear concave-down quadric function that was still present in the data. The residual from the quadratic model showed no clear trend, apart from an increasing periodic trend that is more prominent in older ages. We can hypothesize that this is reflective of noise in the data and in lack of as many data points for older people(50-99) than in younger age groups(18-50). From this, we can see that people in the age group of 40-60 are , on average, the heaviest group, so they should be monitered more closely for diseases that stem from being overweight. 

We can also see that the 65+ age group loses weight rapidly, so they should be monitored for too quick of weight loss as well and should focus on retaining weight to remain healthy. We can use this to warn groups approaching these age categories to be cognizant of their weight and to try and prevent any drastic changes to preserve their health.

__Statistics of General Heatlh__

Health Plan|Mean   |SD
-----------|-------|-------
Overall    |3.64565|1.04859
Yes        |3.67813|1.041252
No         |3.42076|1.071586

I created two graphs to represent this data. The first graph is a bar plot, which shows the overall count of people with each category of general health. The graph is also colored to show if the individual has a health plan or not. The second graph is a violin plot which shows the distribution of of people in each general health category. As you can see from these two graphs, there is a small difference between the general health of those who have and do not have a health plan. Most individuals without a health plan put more "3s" or "Good" as their self-reported general health. 

I also calculated the means and standard deviations for each health plan as well as the overall mean and standard deviation. From these results, I conluded that while having a health plan increased your overall health, it was not by much (0.2 difference in means). Similarly, looking at the first graph, most people have a health plan than do not, so the relation between general health and data could be further explored with more data from individuals who do not have a helath plan. 

I used the recently learned skill of string detection and factors in order to change the genhelth column to numbers in order to calculate mean and standard deviation. 

## Team Contributions

We all spent time working with the graphing capabilities of R and each created our own plot that supports the overarching question of the lab. 

We all posted our parts to the shared document and wrote summaries/descriptions to go with our data. Anna, Chris, and James worked through plotting the team graph, and Amanda and Anna wrote in an analysis, conclusion, and recommendations for the findings. Amanda then edited thefinal document and did the finishing touches to turning it in.
