Question: How much does lottery of birth and the economic status that people are born into relate to a person's probability of going to college?

Six months after graduation, I want to treat myself to a vacation somewhere out of the country with a group of friends from college and never work. 
But realistically, hopefully I can get a job that relates economics, data science, and statistics in a way that makes me happy in my work environment. 
Following that, in five years, I want to feel pretty settled in a career, with genuine friends around me, and I want to be happy and fiscally independent more than anything else.

In my future career, I don't really have any specific accomplishment because I have absolutely no idea what I want my future to be like, but I feel like I will find passions once I am in the field more. 
Really, I just hope that I find a career that breeds eternal curiosity, maybe in research dealing with big data. I think learning how to code in a language that is widely used in the data science and statistics field will be very beneficial, and I am hoping to be comfortable with R by the end of this course.

One question that I'm interested in that can be answered with data is, is there a correlation between height and back problems. 

In six months, I plan on going to graduate school for applied math. Five years after that, I want to have a high paying job doing something math related. 

I'm not completely certain of what I want my greatest career accomplishment to be. I guess I want to be successful and thrive in the career I choose. 

I hope to get some exposure to data science and to learn R in this class. I'm hoping that this class will give me some clarity on what I will focus on in graduate school. 

Something interesting about myself is that I play a lot of basketball and have done so most of my life.

I would like to answer the question of how large communities (or fandoms) can impact a company or brand's overall value.

Six months out of graduation, I would like to have a job that pays above minimum wage. Five years after graduation, I would like to have a job that pays better than the one I had six months out of college.

I hope my greatest career acomplisment would be that I never gave up on a project.

I hope to learn R so I can apply and be competivie for internships/careers in Data Science and Economics (or even Finance)

A fun fact about myself is that I love Animal Crossing and cannot wait until Nintendo Announces anything on their upcoming project...
