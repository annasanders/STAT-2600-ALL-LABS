![A decent photo of myself](https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20543582_1451098261626153_5115894972998174498_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&oh=8b77befaaf424e55cedf8bd1a362ccc0&oe=5CCB0068)
I would like to answer the question of how large communities (or fandoms) can impact a company or brand's overall value.
Six months out of graduation, I would like to have a job that pays above minimum wage. Five years after graduation, I would like to have a job that pays better than the one I had six months out of college.
I hope my greatest career acomplisment would be that I never gave up on a project.
I hope to learn R so I can apply and be competivie for internships/careers in Data Science and Economics (or even Finance)
A fun fact about myself is that I love Animal Crossing and cannot wait until Nintendo Announces anything on their upcoming project...
