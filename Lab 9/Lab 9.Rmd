## Anna (When is bicycle traffic the highest, and where are people going?)
I answered this question in the context of overall volume of rides per day. I sorted the data by days, not by time, as certain months in the year would throw off regular commuting data (i.e. the people who ride these bikes to work and the people who only use these bikes in the summer). 

```{r, eval= FALSE}

# Loading the Data normally
bikes1 <- read_csv("Nice_ride_trip_history_2017_season.csv")

# Separating by month/year
bikedate <-bikes1%>%
  separate(`Start date`, into= c("Sdate", "Stime"), sep= " ")%>%
  separate(`End date`, into= c("Edate", "Etime"), sep= " ")

bikedate1 <-bikedate%>%
  separate(Sdate, into= c("Smon", "Sday", "Syear"), sep= "/")%>%
  separate(Edate, into= c("Emon", "Eday", "Eyear"), sep= "/")

As you can see from the top five dates for renting a bike, most days fall around The Fourth of July, which is an important American holiday. The City of Minneapolis has a fireworks show near the Stone Arch Bridge, which is located near the 100 Main Street SE Location. The other locations are near outdoor landmarks like parks, lakes, or the Mississippi River. From the graph, it is easy to see that a large share of the rides come from the summer months, where one could assume that many children are out of school and many parents take their children to do outdoor activities. This dataset only had data from April to November, so one can assume that the service shut down during those months, as Minnesota gets lots of snow during the winter. 

## James (Where is the most of the revenue generated?)
To answer this question, I had to make several assumptions. In the data set, there was no way to differentiate users, which leads to counting problems. For instance, there are over 290,000 recorded member bike rides, and only 170,646 casual bike rides, but it's very likely that there are less members than casuals. For each casuals and members, there were also different subsets of each type of account, and just like before, there is no way to differentiate this. The best we can do without these numbers is to make educated guesses and from that, determine where most of the revenue comes from. 

Let's start with some simple assumptions. To start, we know that the population of Minneapolis in 2017 was just over 420,000 thousand people. Our first assumption is that one-tenth of the population has tried or consistenly used Nice Ride. This leaves us with around 42,000 people. Next, let's say that 85% of those people are casuals, and the rest are full members. So we have 35,700 casuals and 6,300 members. This was calculated by assuming that users purchase the annual membership if they bike enough so that it's cheaper than buying many single ride passes. Our final assumption to ease computation, is to assume that all the casuals use single ride passes. 

Now to calculate the revenue, we used Nice Ride's 2018 system of pricing. For a single ride pass, it costs $2 for a 30-min ride, and an additional $2 for going over the 30-min limit. For an annual member, it costs $75 dollars for unlimited 60-min rides, and $2 for each additional 30-mins.  

By filtering through the data and calculating sums, we determined a rough estimate for the amount of revenue generated by each type of user. Casuals brought in $535,228 and members brought in $486732. Note: This is a very rough estimate. There are definitely more clever ways to get better estimations for the assumptions we started with. 
Under the basis of my assumptions, I wanted to look at the ratio of being late for casuals and members. This can be seen in the plot below. Perhaps, maybe one of the reasons we came to the conclusion that casuals brought in more revenue, was that a larger proportion of them returned the bike late, which brought in extra fees.
