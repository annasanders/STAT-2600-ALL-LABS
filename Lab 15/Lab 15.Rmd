# I WANT TO BE THE VERY BEST (like no one ever was)

Our main question is how to be the best (like no one ever was). Like the famous theme song says:
" I want to be the very best,
Like no one ever was. 
To catch them is my real test, #Catch Rate, Base Egg Steps
To train them is my cause! #Exp Growth

I will travel across the land, #Generation, Pokedex Number
Searching far and wide. #Type
Each Pokemon to understand #Classification, Happiness
The power that's inside! #Base Total, Against_
Pokemon! #Height, Weight
Gotta catch em' all!"

Taking data from the equally famous video game franchise, we are wondering how exactly a trainer can become the best (in the video games at least). Using the parameters set out in the original song (inclucding catch rate, type, power, happines, abilities, and much more), we seek to determine exactly what to do in order to be the very best.


#Amanda (How does gender of a pokemon correlate with the quality of it?)

Is there a significant difference between base totals of pokemon types that tend to be mostly female versus types that tend to be mostly male versus types that have a 50/50 chance of being either gender?

This question is important in determining how to be the most successful in the game of Pokemon because when catching a Pokemon, a player would want Pokemon with a higher base total, because this means that it overall is better in defense, attack, speed, and other important components to how good of a character it is. Therefore, I want to see if there is a relationship between the likely gender of the Pokemon and how good of a Pokemon it tends to be. This question is also interesting in general in seeing if there is a significant difference in the base totals between genders because this would exemplify that all Pokemon are not created equal.

To create this graph, I first filtered my data to make it easier to read and analyze, only keeping the columns that I would using for the analysis of Pokemon. In my process, I was looking at how mean base totals compare based on the likely gender of Pokemon. The higher the base total, the better the Pokemon. Then, I split by data up based on gender, and did two-sample permutation tests for sample sizes equal to the number of mostly male Pokemon, number of mostly female Pokemon, and number of Pokemon who have a 50/50 chance of being each gender. This was done in order to see how far from average the mean base totals would be expected to be if a random sample were taken from the entire data, which is illustrated by the three normal-distributed histograms in the graph. I then calculated what the actual average distance in mean base total was for each gender and plotted these on the graph, with blue representing mostly males, pink representing mostly females, and green representing Pokemon that have a 50/50 chance of being born as either gender.

From this graph, we can see that both mostly female Pokemon and Pokemon with an equal chance of being each gender have slightly smaller base totals than what would be expected if there were no correlation between gender and base total. However, for these two categories of Pokemon, there z-scores were -0.371 and -1.175, respectively. Since these are both less than two standard deviations away from the mean, these differences are most likely not statistically significant; therefore, we cannot say that these two categories of Pokemon would tend to be less than average. Therefore, in playing the game, a player should not be deterred from catching these kinds of Pokemon because they are not likely to be worse. On the other hand, Pokemon that are mostly male tend to have base totals that are higher than would be expected if there were no correlation between gender and base total. For the mostly male Pokemon, their z-score 2.799, meaning that there is a significant difference in the base totals of the mostly male Pokemon versus the rest of the Pokemon in the game. From this conclusion, if a player were to play the game, it is recommended that they would put more effort and value into catching Pokemon that tend to be male, because this will more likely end up in them having better Pokemon, thus being the best player possible.

Here we can see that, overall, the mean base stats for generations as a whole conclude that generation 4 possesses the strongest pokemon (in terms of overall stats). The generation with the overall weakest pokemon is generation 2. From the model fitting, we see that a linear model shows a increase in power from the pokemon at the start of the pokedex to those at the end, but when we look at the entire data, we see spikes at the beginning of the pokedex for each generation and the end of the pokedex for each generation. This means a linear model is not sufficient since it wont pick up these trends. For this reason, we also showed a 10th degree polynomial to fit the data. The model more accurately reflects the nature of the pokemon rank in the pokedex; however, when we look at the residuals for this model, we see large residuals. For this reason, we created an (impractical) 800th degree polynomial to model the pokedex. When we did this, we see the residuals are very small and dont have much of a trend at all, so we know our model accurately reflects the pokedex and the stats of those pokemon. From this analysis, we know that the pokemon at the beginning and end of the pokedex for each generation are the strongest. This would correlate to the starters and the legendaries of each generation. Overall, the legendary pokemon are stronger than the starters because, after all, they are legendary. With this analysis combined, we see that if you seek to be the very best trainer, you will want to have a team of starter and legendary pokemon from generation 4. If you seek to maximize stats, you will want a team of ALL legendary pokemon from genration 4, but based off of competitive pokemon rules, they ban legendaries, so solely based on max stats of a pokemon, you will want to use starters from generation four in their final evolutions (Torterra, Infernape, and Empoleon). If allowed to use legendaries, the data would reccomend to use legendaries such as Dialga, Palkia or Giritina. The data also conveys that pokemon colser to the end of the pokedex, but not the very end, are also have higher base stats. This is due to the fact that, in the game, pokemon that fill the end of the pokedex are encountered at the victory road right before challenging the elite four and pokemon champion, so naturally, these will be better pokemon. If you are still sticking with generation four being thr strongest, these will be pokemon such as Garchomp and Metagross-- namely pseudolegendary pokemon for their extremely high stats, but for being naturally occuring pokemon and not associated with mythical origins.

#Reflections on Lab 2
As a team, restate your team's goal(s) and reflect on how well you achieved it. If you could travel back in time, which is one thing you would tell your team to keep doing? Stop doing? Start doing? Discuss this as a team and add it as a section to your Final Project.

Individually, write a paragraph reflecting on: how have your six-month or 5-year goals changed? What did you learn/accomplish in this course? If you could give yourself advice at the beginning of the semester, what would you tell yourself to keep doing, stop doing, and start doing?
